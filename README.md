# Insta*** pop-out button

This is a Chrome extension that improves the Instagram interface by adding a button on top of the images that opens the corresponding image in a new tab in higher resolution.

Turns out, Instagram stores hi res versions of all the images! For some reason, it still only lets us see 614px wide thumbnails of them. Crops them, too! Isn't that a bit weird for a social network that's ostensibly all about pictures and original content? Oh well...

Normally, you would be able to do that from the context menu by right clicking the image, but Instagram doesn't allow that.

## How to install

_This extension was taken down from Chrome store due to a copyright strike on behalf of Instagram, with no way of restoring it. I personally find it ridiculous and unfair._

It can still be installed manually, of course:

- Download the source
- Go to the Chrome extensions page (chrome://extensions)
- Turn on the `developer mode` in the top right corner
- Press the `Load unpacked` button in the top left corner
- Navigate to the directory where you've downloaded the extension source
